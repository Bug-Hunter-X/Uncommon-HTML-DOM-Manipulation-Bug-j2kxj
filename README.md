# Uncommon HTML DOM Manipulation Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to removing elements from the DOM using the `remove()` method in HTML.  The bug highlights an uncommon error that can be easily overlooked.

## Bug Description
The `remove()` method is used to remove an element from the DOM. However, directly calling `remove()` on an element can lead to unexpected behavior, and in some browsers, it may throw an error. 
The correct approach involves using the `remove()` method on the parent element of the node to be removed.  This example shows how to correctly remove the element.

## Solution
The solution involves utilizing the parentNode of the target element to correctly execute the `remove()` method.
